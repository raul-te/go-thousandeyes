# thousandeyes-sdk-go
`thousandeyes-sdk-go` is a [go](https://golang.org/) client library for the [Thousandeyes v6 API](https://developer.thousandeyes.com/v6).

## Installation
thousandeyes-sdk-go is compatible with modern Go releases in module mode, with Go installed:

```cli
go get github.com/thousandeyes/thousandeyes-sdk-go/v2
```

will resolve and add the package to the current development module, along with its dependencies.

Alternatively the same can be achieved if you use import in a package:
```go
import "github.com/thousandeyes/thousandeyes-sdk-go/v2"
```

and run go get without parameters.

## Usage
Example code to list ThousandEyes agents:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/thousandeyes/thousandeyes-sdk-go/v2"
)

func main() {
	opts := thousandeyes.ClientOptions{
		AuthToken: os.Getenv("TE_TOKEN"),
		AccountID: os.Getenv("TE_AID"),
	}

	client := thousandeyes.NewClient(&opts)
	agents, err := client.GetAgents()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	for _, a := range *agents {
		fmt.Println(*a.AgentName)
	}
}
```
